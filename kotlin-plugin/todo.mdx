### Current TODOs

- run-task integration (waiting on https://github.com/jpenilla/run-task/pull/146)
  - once that is merged/we fork the repo, we need to either ->
    - find a way to hook into the task's configuration, cc: @Toffikk 
    - provide an example plugin with the proper configurations applied
    
- ~~probably should read plugin yaml like the core launcher does~~
  - this would require some dirty casting. do we really want/need that?

### Reference: 
- current plugin configuration format ->

```gradle
horizon {
  accessTransformerFiles.from(
    file("build-data/first.at"),
    file("build-data/second.at"),
  )
}
```
